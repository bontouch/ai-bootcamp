Using tools
===========

Use tools like remote MCP servers or web search to extend the model's capabilities.

When generating model responses, you can extend capabilities using built‑in tools and remote MCP servers. These enable the model to search the web, retrieve from your files, call your own functions, or access third‑party services.

Web search

Include web search results for the model response

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    input="What was a positive news story from today?"
)

print(response.output_text)
```

File search

Search your files in a response

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"]
    }]
)
print(response)
```

Function calling

Call your own function

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia",
                }
            },
            "required": ["location"],
            "additionalProperties": False,
        },
        "strict": True,
    },
]

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in Paris today?"},
    ],
    tools=tools,
)

print(response.output[0].to_json())
```

Remote MCP

Call a remote MCP server

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "mcp",
            "server_label": "dmcp",
            "server_description": "A Dungeons and Dragons MCP server to assist with dice rolling.",
            "server_url": "https://dmcp-server.deno.dev/sse",
            "require_approval": "never",
        },
    ],
    input="Roll 2d4+1",
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

Available tools
---------------

Here's an overview of the tools available in the OpenAI platform—select one of them for further guidance on usage.

[

Function calling

Call custom code to give the model access to additional data and capabilities.

](/docs/guides/function-calling)[

Web search

Include data from the Internet in model response generation.

](/docs/guides/tools-web-search)[

Remote MCP servers

Give the model access to new capabilities via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

](/docs/guides/tools-remote-mcp)[

File search

Search the contents of uploaded files for context when generating a response.

](/docs/guides/tools-file-search)[

Image generation

Generate or edit images using GPT Image.

](/docs/guides/tools-image-generation)[

Code interpreter

Allow the model to execute code in a secure container.

](/docs/guides/tools-code-interpreter)[

Computer use

Create agentic workflows that enable a model to control a computer interface.

Usage in the API
----------------

When making a request to generate a [model response](/docs/api-reference/responses/create), you can enable tool access by specifying configurations in the `tools` parameter. Each tool has its own unique configuration requirements—see the [Available tools](/docs/guides/tools#available-tools) section for detailed instructions.

Based on the provided [prompt](/docs/guides/text), the model automatically decides whether to use a configured tool. For instance, if your prompt requests information beyond the model's training cutoff date and web search is enabled, the model will typically invoke the web search tool to retrieve relevant, up-to-date information.

You can explicitly control or guide this behavior by setting the `tool_choice` parameter [in the API request](/docs/api-reference/responses/create).

### Function calling

In addition to built-in tools, you can define custom functions using the `tools` array. These custom functions allow the model to call your application's code, enabling access to specific data or capabilities not directly available within the model.

Learn more in the [function calling guide](/docs/guides/function-calling).
