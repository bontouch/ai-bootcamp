Developer quickstart
====================

Take your first steps with the OpenAI API.

The OpenAI API provides a simple interface to state-of-the-art AI [models](/docs/models) for text generation, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. This example generates [text output](/docs/guides/text) from a prompt, as you might using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com).

Generate text from a model
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input="Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
)

print(response.output_text)
```

Configure your development environment

Install and configure an official OpenAI SDK to run the code above.

Analyze images and files
------------------------

Send image URLs, uploaded files, or PDF documents directly to the model to extract text, classify content, or detect visual elements.

Image URL

Analyze the content of an image

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "input_text",
                    "text": "What teams are playing in this image?",
                },
                {
                    "type": "input_image",
                    "image_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/LeBron_James_Layup_%28Cleveland_vs_Brooklyn_2018%29.jpg"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

File URL

Use a file URL as input

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "input_text",
                    "text": "Analyze the letter and provide a summary of the key points.",
                },
                {
                    "type": "input_file",
                    "file_url": "https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2024ltr.pdf",
                },
            ],
        },
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

Upload file

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

file = client.files.create(
    file=open("draconomicon.pdf", "rb"),
    purpose="user_data"
)

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "input_file",
                    "file_id": file.id,
                },
                {
                    "type": "input_text",
                    "text": "What is the first dragon in the book?",
                },
            ]
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

Extend the model with tools
---------------------------

Give the model access to external data and functions by attaching [tools](/docs/guides/tools). Use built-in tools like web search or file search, or define your own for calling APIs, running code, or integrating with third-party systems.

Web search

Use web search in a response

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    input="What was a positive news story from today?"
)

print(response.output_text)
```
File search

Search your files in a response

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"]
    }]
)
print(response)
```

Function calling

Call your own function

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia",
                }
            },
            "required": ["location"],
            "additionalProperties": False,
        },
        "strict": True,
    },
]

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in Paris today?"},
    ],
    tools=tools,
)

print(response.output[0].to_json())
```

Remote MCP

Call a remote MCP server

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "mcp",
            "server_label": "dmcp",
            "server_description": "A Dungeons and Dragons MCP server to assist with dice rolling.",
            "server_url": "https://dmcp-server.deno.dev/sse",
            "require_approval": "never",
        },
    ],
    input="Roll 2d4+1",
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

Stream responses and build realtime apps
----------------------------------------

Use server‑sent [streaming events](/docs/guides/streaming-responses) to show results as they’re generated, or the [Realtime API](/docs/guides/realtime) for interactive voice and multimodal apps.

Stream server-sent events from the API

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

stream = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say 'double bubble bath' ten times fast.",
        },
    ],
    stream=True,
)

for event in stream:
    print(event)
```

[

Use streaming events

Use server-sent events to stream model responses to users fast.

](/docs/guides/streaming-responses)[

Get started with the Realtime API

Use WebRTC or WebSockets for super fast speech-to-speech AI apps.

](/docs/guides/realtime)

Build agents
------------

Use the OpenAI platform to build [agents](/docs/guides/agents) capable of taking action—like [controlling computers](/docs/guides/tools-computer-use)—on behalf of your users. Use the Agents SDK for [Python](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python) or [TypeScript](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js) to create orchestration logic on the backend.

Build a language triage agent

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
import asyncio

spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="Spanish agent",
    instructions="You only speak Spanish.",
)

english_agent = Agent(
    name="English agent",
    instructions="You only speak English",
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage agent",
    instructions="Handoff to the appropriate agent based on the language of the request.",
    handoffs=[spanish_agent, english_agent],
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, input="Hola, ¿cómo estás?")
    print(result.final_output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
