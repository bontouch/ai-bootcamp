# Retrieval Labs
In this session there are two available notebooks. The plan is that you should be able to finish both but you can select which one you want to start with.

## PDF Parsing
Pre-processing of data is a very important step in systems making use of RAG. It can take very different shapes and the idea in this notebook is to expand your vision on what this could look like. We will look at a simple, yet powerful example showing how the multimodal capabilities of LLMs opens up a new range of use cases. The notebook comes from an OpenAI Cookbook originally (https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/parse_pdf_docs_for_rag)

## Graph RAG
Here we will follow a notebook from OpenAI (https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/rag_with_graph_db). It's a bit more advanced RAG system using a graph database and gives insight into how the concept of retrieval can be applied in different ways.
