The delivery was late but the product quality is excellent!
I've been a customer for 3 years and generally love your service. However, last month I was charged twice for my subscription. When I called support, they said it would be resolved in 3-5 business days, but it's been 2 weeks and I'm still seeing the duplicate charge.
This product is garbage and your company should burn!
Great service, very happy!
The new website design is confusing. I can't find the support section anywhere.
Your chat support agent Sarah was incredibly helpful in resolving my billing issue quickly.
The mobile app crashes every time I try to upload photos. Very frustrating experience.
Love the recent updates to your dashboard - much more intuitive now!
I ordered premium support but keep getting transferred to different departments.
The price increase was unexpected but I understand the value you provide.
Been trying to cancel my subscription for weeks but your website won't let me.
Outstanding customer service from your technical support team!
The installation guide is poorly written and missing important steps.
Perfect product, exactly what I needed. Will definitely order again.
Your automated phone system is terrible - impossible to reach a human.
